# Specification: Dynamic Columnar Workflow

## 1. Overview
This specification details the dynamic behavior and layout of the workflow operations, treating each step as a column within a grid-like structure. The focus is on the "exploding" interaction model where the active operation expands to reveal details and data, while others minimize.

## 2. Layout Structure

### Vertical Column Layout
Each operation (Step) is visualized as a vertical column. The basic anatomy of a column is as follows (top to bottom):

1.  **Operation Header**
    *   **Operation Name**: The label of the step.
    *   **Status Indicator**: Displayed immediately below the name (e.g., Idle, Running, Done).
2.  **Mini Toolbar**
    *   Compact controls for execution (Run, Pause/Stop).
3.  **Operation Details (Expander)**
    *   Collapsible section containing configuration parameters and specific settings for the operation.
4.  **Status Details (Expander)**
    *   Collapsible section showing execution logs, timing, or error messages.
5.  **Data Column**
    *   A vertical list of data cells (Cell 1, Cell 2, ... Cell n).
    *   Represents the specific column of data being operated on or generated by this step.

## 3. Interaction Dynamics

### The "Explosion" Effect (Focus Mode)
*   **Trigger**: Clicking on an specific Operation header or column.
*   **Behavior**:
    *   **Active Column**: Expands horizontally to occupy significant screen real estate.
        *   Detailed UI elements (Toolbar, Details, Status) become fully visible and interactive.
        *   Data cells resize to accommodate detailed content (e.g., larger fonts, formatted views).
    *   **Inactive Columns**: Minimize effectively.
        *   They compress horizontally.
        *   Details/Status expanders automatically collapse.
        *   Data cells may shrink to a summary view, simple icons, or just a narrow color bar/sparkline representation.

### Default State
*   Standard view where all columns have equal width (or collapsed width if no specific focus is set), suitable for an overview of the entire flow.

### Transition Animations
*   Smooth CSS transitions should handle the resizing of columns and cells to maintain context (the "Excel with superpowers" feel).

## 4. UI Component Updates
*   **Step Component**: Must now act as a layout container for the entire column (Header + Details + Data).
*   **Data Grid**: Instead of a single wide grid at the bottom, the grid is effectively transposed or split so that each Step controls and visualizes its specific column of data.
