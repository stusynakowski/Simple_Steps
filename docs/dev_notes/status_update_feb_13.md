# UI looks more processing

# next objectives
# need to track the following
# UI componsents

# overview expander for a step
# operation to operation details
# data

# make sure expander collapses the entire tab
#

# data call implies states
# Ran, staged, not defined,running failed,


# operation details
# operation wrapper, operation name, arguments,
# you can edit the status change the operation
# update the arguments


# this component will be reactive (lazy computing)

# you can then run (and it will produce an error for the cell)


# need to understand serialization and API processing

# to build, operation run results and get databack

# need a mechanism to store the current arguments defined by the UI to call the backend


# knowing the environment helps

# step arguments

# operation arguments(Step_Names,conditional arguments), orchestration (array method) map, reduce, expand, filter, pivot, sort etc.


# sidebar need to add compute

# need to have resources
